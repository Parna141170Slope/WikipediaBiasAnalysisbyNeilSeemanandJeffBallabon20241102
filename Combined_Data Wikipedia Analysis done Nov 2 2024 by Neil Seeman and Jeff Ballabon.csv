,6.Summary_Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Total Edits: All edits made by the contributor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,6.Summary_Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A contributor is classified as ""high-bias"" when their Bias Ratio exceeds 0.1, meaning more than 10% of their edits contain bias indicators. This calculation is documented in the bias-related tab and methodological sections of the analysis, which shows the use of ""Keyword analysis in edit summaries for bias-related terms and content disputes"" and ""ratio calculations"" as part of the methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,6.Summary_Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The bias indicators are tracked in two categories:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,6.Summary_Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Strong Bias Keywords: Including terms like genocide, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, war crime, massacre",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,6.Summary_Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2. Contextual Bias Phrases: Including terms that indicate bias when used in certain contexts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,6.Summary_Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This threshold of 0.1 was chosen to identify users whose edits consistently show patterns of potentially biased language while allowing for occasional use of these terms in appropriate contexts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
